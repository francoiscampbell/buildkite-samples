# this pipeline runs the same script three times in parallel
# one thing i noticed is that env vars in the yaml are substituted early,
# using $BUILDKITE_PARALLEL_JOB here results in an empty string, it has to be
# used in a separate script
steps:
  - command: 02-parallel/script.sh
    label: echo %n
    parallelism: 3
